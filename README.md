# PrintFUN Group Project- Cohort 14

## Project

1. [Printf](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/228)

## Description

This is a recreation of a popular C language function that can do formatted printing to standard output. Tasked to us by Holberton School, this emulation of the already popular function will provide us with a better understanding of the inner workings of the printf function.
